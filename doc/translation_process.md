Translations
============

The SafeCash Official project has been designed to support multiple localisations. This makes adding new phrases, and completely new languages easily achievable. For managing all application translations, SafeCash Official makes use of the Transifex online translation management tool.

Currently, the best way to help with translations is to use the [SafeCash Forums](https://safecash.io/forum/)

Soon we will integrate into the Transifex project to assist in translations.
